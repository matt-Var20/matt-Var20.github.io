Hello, my name is Matthias Vargas. I'm originally from Victoria, Texas, but 8 years ago I moved to Clewiston, Florida. I enrolled in this class at Itech because I want a career in cybersecurity. Taking this classs has helped me learn so many interesting and useful things. My professional goals are to get my COMPTIA A+ and my Security +, and then either get a IT job or an entry level cybersecurity job. Then, I'd like to work my way through other certificates to eventually become a well known and well payed professional. I'm so excited for what God has instore for my future and I can't wait to see what's next!
