Hello, my name is Matthias and this is my test repository. I'm originally from Victoria, Texas, but 8 years ago i moved to Clewiston. Florida. I enrolled in this class at Itech because i want a career in cybersecurity. Taking this classs has helped me realize that I want to be on the Red team and learn pentesting. My professional goals are to get my Comptia A+ and my Security +, and then either get a IT job or an entry level cybersecurity job. Then, i'd like to work my way through other certificates to eventually become a certified pentester for major companies like banks and hospitals.
